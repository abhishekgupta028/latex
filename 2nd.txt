{\LaTeX} eases our pressure in writing thesis \& reports because of its powerful features such as automatic hyphenation, table of contents, figures \& tables, powerful bibliography tool, citations, Automatic Numbering of Chapter, sections, figures \& tables, its beautiful fonts, professional output..

Writing too much of code gives bad impression on {\LaTeX}. But now we have numerous GUI tools like gedit=latex=plugin, {\TeX}maker, LyX \& Emacs, which are very much user friendly.

This VTU=project=report=template is written using popular document class, "Memoir". In the coming chapters, we have given small help manual required for writing report \& at the end about template.
